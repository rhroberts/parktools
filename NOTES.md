# Project notes

- Running `get_league_batting_data()` takes a some time if you query a span greater than a few weeks
    - Grab a snack while you wait :p

# To-Do

- [ ] ` data.pre_process()` needs to be more general,  it makes some assumptions

  - particularly that we want to calculate BA/BABIP-related stuff

  - see line 207 of `data.py`
