# parktools

Python tools for the ballpark!

This project is in *very* early days. It is an attempt to generalize some python code I use frequently when looking at baseball data. Over time, I hope to build it out into a nice collection of tools with which to query, process, and analyze MLB and MiLB data. `parktools` relies heavily on the very awesome [pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) package.
